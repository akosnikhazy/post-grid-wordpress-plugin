# post-grid-wordpress-plugin

I needed a solution to have a page with posts with a predefined category while the same category does not show up on the home screen. It spiraled to be this plugin where you can select multiple categories to be in a grid and you can choose to exlude or include them on the home page.

A version of this runs here: https://akosirkal.blog/jatek-lista/

# How to install?
Just copy the post-grid-wordpress-plugin folder in wp-content/plugins/ folder. Or zip the folder and upload it on plugin admin page on WordPress.

# Warning
This version is not the one that might or might not be on the official plugin directory. This has non of the security functionality that WordPress enforcess on plugins. Read the license.
